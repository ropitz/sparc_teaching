-   **Optional:** If you want to try running one of the fingerprints
    you've identified through the [Fingerprint Minutiae
    Viewer](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/fingerprint-minutiae-viewer-fpmv)
    software (see image on the right), be sure to use the 'Save
    Snapshot' function in Meshlab so that the trackball is not visible
    in the image. You will also need an image editing software (like
    Adobe Photoshop) to convert your image to 8-bit greyscale.

    -   Ensure that the raised areas of the fingerprint (in this case,
        the areas highlighted in red) are black in the image. In Adobe
        Photoshop, you can change the reds to black by using Image \>
        Adjustments \> Black & White and adjusting the 'Reds' slider so
        that the ridges appear black (but be sure that the strange
        'squiggly lines' of noise are not overemphasised in this
        process).

    -   Then use Image \> Mode \> Greyscale to convert it to Greyscale
        and ensure that the 8-bit option is checked. Then export the
        image as a .png file.

    -   Once you have installed FMV, you can open your new image of the
        fingerprint in the software and see what Minutiae are
        identified. Be sure to critically analyse these -- do the
        features highlighted in green appear to be reliable, distinctive
        features, as highlighted in Kimberlee Moran's handout, or do
        they appear to be digital artefacts?
